JMDOTS Workbench is an OS-agnostic utility suite.

## Tools

### `wbcopy` | `wbpaste`

These tools provide simple `copy` and `paste` functionality from the command line.

| Feature                         | `wbcopy` | `wbpaste` | Example Usage                    |
|---------------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Copy text from string           | `X`      |           | `wbcopy "Hello, World!"`         |
| Copy text from file             | `X`      |           | `wbcopy -f filename.txt`         |
| Copy text from pipe (stdout)    | `X`      |           | `echo "Hello, World!" \| wbcopy` |
| Paste text to stdout            |          | `X`       | `wbpaste`                        |
| Paste text to file              |          | `X`       | `wbpaste -f output.txt`          |

NOTE: `wbcopy` and `wbpaste` are supported only for local operations. Operations over `ssh` are not supported.

### `wbrebase`

This tool automates the process of `git` rebasing the current branch on top of the `main` branch.

Usage: `wbrebase`

Steps taken by `wbrebase`:

- Step 1: Stow current branch name
- Step 2: Switch to main branch
- Step 3: Fetch all updates
- Step 4: Pull latest changes
- Step 5: Switch back to original branch
- Step 6: Rebase on main
- Step 7: Push changes
- Step 8: Show commit log

## Installation

To install the project to your host Python conda environment outside of Poetry, ensure you have Poetry and GNU Make installed as prerequisites. Then follow these steps:

1. Ensure Poetry and GNU Make are installed:

```bash
# Install Poetry
pip install poetry

# Install GNU Make (if not already installed)
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install make
```

2. As an example of where you can install, activate your desired conda environment:

```bash
conda activate <your_env_name>
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ~/src/workbench
```

4. Install the project using the following command:

```bash
make install
```

5. After installing the project, you can use the installed commands (`wbcopy` and `wbpaste`) directly from your conda environment.
